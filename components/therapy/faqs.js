                Have a look at the section above where I talk about this more
                fully in terms of length and approach. Once we make contact I
                can discuss this with you further and we can work out together,
                in our initial consultation, what might be best for you.

            <p>
                I understand that therapy can be a serious financial commitment.
                It is worth investigating whether your employer can offer
                sessions via an Employee Assistance Programme (I have experience
                with Validium, Lifeworks and Compsych) or a private health
                provider - I am registered with most major providers including
                BUPA, Cigna, AXA PPP. On occasion, I can offer a reduced fee and
                we can discuss this.

            <p>
                Therapy is also a commitment in your time and in my experience
                you will benefit more when you feel ‘ready’ for the commitment
                rather than being told to do it by a friend or family member,
                however well-meaning. To that end, you and I will find a
                mutually convenient time and day and endeavour to meet weekly
                (sometimes twice weekly is preferable). I always try to
                accommodate the reality of your life and therefore will do my
                best should you need to reschedule occasionally and can give
                good notice. Because I will commit that time to you every week
                and ask you to do the same so I do generally charge for missed
                sessions. However, I do not charge for the weeks that I take as
                breaks which are around 6-8 week a year for which I give good
                notice.

                Yes, I can be your therapist whilst your train. Please check to
                see if my training and mode of practice are compatible with your
                course requirements. I suggest we discuss this further should
                you be interested.

            <p>
                Currently, I am not practising any face-to-face therapy and all
                sessions are via VC. This is in line with government
                requirements and the advice of my professional bodies. If it
                doesn’t feel that this could work for you please do let us
                discuss this but in my recent experience, sessions can still
                function well and often make finding time in your schedule
                easier.

            <p>
                I don’t think of problems as big or small, rare or common,
                complicated or otherwise – I’m more interested in what your
                experience of your life is like. If you have identified a
                particular issue(s) then we’ll start there. I will take time, in
                the beginning, to learn about your life – past and present – and
                we’ll be looking for links and patterns. In my experience, it is
                often not what you come to me about that remains our central
                focus: it is because I have a different viewpoint that I may see
                something different that we’ll then explore. I have spoken to
                many people over the years with diverse histories and very
                different experiences and although we are all unique our
                problems are often similar, shared and have commonality.

                Yes, all sessions are strictly confidential. In very exceptional
                circumstances, it may become evident that we should escalate
                concerns about your safety to other professional such as your
                GP. However, this is always done in discussion with you and only
                with your agreement would I make contact with anyone else.

            <p>
                Psychotherapy isn’t just for those times of crisis although it
                of course when it can be a real help. But at other times we want
                to learn about ourselves to get more out of life, to live, love
                and play with more intensity, satisfaction and joy. Socrates
                said something of this:{' '}
                <blockquote>
                    An unexamined life is not worth living. <br />
                    Not life, but good life, is to be chiefly valued.
