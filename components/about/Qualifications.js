                    <p>
                        I am a fully qualified Psychotherapist and hold a
                        Postgraduate Diploma in Psychodynamic Psychotherapy
                        Theory &amp; Practice from WPF, a highly regarded
                        training institution in London that combines the
                        academic study of theory with clinical experience. The
                        course is ratified by Roehampton University.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Aside from my private practice, I have worked within the
                        NHS and charities seeing a diverse group of service
                        users. In addition, I have extensive experience as a
                        forensic psychotherapist with clients in a secure
                        setting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe in the importance of continuing my
                        professional development and regularly attend workshops
                        and seminars to develop skills and explore thinking
                        using a wide range of theories, from classic
                        psychoanalysis to techniques developing from psychology
                        and neuroscience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before becoming a psychotherapist I had a career in the
                        arts and creative businesses, so I am particularly
                        interested in how creative talent works effectively
                        within the commercial world.
