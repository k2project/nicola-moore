                    We are all experiencing a different world right now, much of
                    it worrying and confusing. In a time when we are told to
                    keep our distance in order to stay safe, we find we need to
                    connect more than ever. We are learning new
                    ways to be together and the same goes for getting the right
                    support in a time of need.

                    With therapy online – via Video Conference - we can meet
                    without the usual restrictions of place and time that
                    previously often made it tricky.
                </p>

                    I can still offer a safe place for you to explore your
                    feelings and work through difficult issues. Why not try out
                    a session and we can take it from there. Therapy is about
                    establishing a rapport and my positive experiences with VC
                    have shown this can happen online too.
