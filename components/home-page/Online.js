                    We are all experiencing a different world right now, much of
                    it worrying and confusing. In a time when we are told that
                    the best we can do to take care of each other is to stay
                    apart, is just when find we really need to connect and get
                    the right support so we are learning new ways to be with
                    each other.

                    With therapy online – via Video Conference - we can meet
                    without the restrictions of place and time that previously
                    made it tricky.

                    I can still offer a safe place for you to explore your
                    feelings and work through difficult issues. Why not try out
                    a session and we can take it from there. Therapy is about
                    establishing a rapport and I have had positive experiences
                    using VC.
