                    Benefit from a therapy <b>wherever you are...</b>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all experiencing a different world right now, much of
                    it worrying and confusing; we are learning new ways to be
                    with each other. Much of this has added to issues we already
                    have. But with therapy online – via Video Conference - we
                    can meet without the restrictions of place and time that
                    previously made it tricky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can still offer a safe place for you to explore your
                    feelings and work through difficult issues. Why not try out
                    a session and we can discuss any apprehension you might
                    have. Therapy is about establishing a rapport and I have had
                    surprisingly good and positive experiences using VC.
